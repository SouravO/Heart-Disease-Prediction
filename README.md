# ‚ù§Ô∏è Heart Disease Prediction  
This project predicts the likelihood of a person having heart disease using various medical parameters. It leverages classification algorithms on a structured dataset (e.g., age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, etc.) to build a predictive model.

## üìå Features  
```markdown
* Preprocessing of the clinical dataset
* Visualization and correlation analysis
* Feature selection and scaling
* Model training with popular classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest)
* Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
* Visualization of the confusion matrix and the ROC curve
```
## üß∞ Requirements  
```markdown
* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* Libraries:
    pandas
    numpy
    matplotlib
    seaborn
    scikit-learn
```
## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation  
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction.git
cd heart-disease-prediction
```
2. Open the notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook "Heart Disease predicition.ipynb"
```
## üöÄ Usage  
```markdown
* Launch the Jupyter Notebook.
* Run all cells to perform:
* Data loading and preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Model training and evaluation
* Check model metrics and plots for interpretation.
```
## üß† Code Overview  
```markdown
* Dataset: Often based on the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset from the UCI repository.
* Preprocessing: Deals with null values, encoding, and normalization.
* EDA: Uses Seaborn and Matplotlib for insights.
* Modeling: Includes Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or SVM.
* Evaluation: Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC, accuracy score.
